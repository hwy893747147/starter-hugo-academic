Howdy! I am currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Department of Computer Science, Rice University. My advisor is [Prof. Xia Hu](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/xiahu/index.html), who leads the DATA Lab. I obtained my bachelor’s degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Jiwen Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TN8uDQoAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My research interests lie in interpretable machine learning, with a particular interest in the areas of DNN interpretability. I'm also interested in areas of fairness in deep learning, backdoor attack, and IP protection of ML pipelines.
